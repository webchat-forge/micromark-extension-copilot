# Pythagorean Theorem

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides (a and b).

\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]

## Applications

1. **Distance Calculation**
   For points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), the distance is:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}
   \]

2. **Triangle Verification**
   If three sides a, b, c satisfy the equation, the triangle is right-angled:
   $$ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 $$

## Common Right Triangle Ratios

Some special right triangles have simple integer ratios:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c & \text{Ratio} \\\\
\hline
3 & 4 & 5 & 3:4:5 \\\\
5 & 12 & 13 & 5:12:13 \\\\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
