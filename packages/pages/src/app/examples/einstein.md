# Mass-Energy Equivalence

Einstein's famous equation relating mass and energy:

$$ E = mc^2 $$

Where:
- E is energy in joules (J)
- m is mass in kilograms (kg)
- c is the speed of light in meters per second (m/s)

## Implications

1. **Mass-Energy Conversion**
   Even a small amount of mass can release enormous energy:
   \[
   \text{1 kg} = (1)(3 \times 10^8)^2 = 9 \times 10^{16} \text{ joules}
   \]

2. **Nuclear Reactions**
   In nuclear fission, mass difference Δm produces energy:
   $$ E = \Delta m c^2 $$

3. **Relativistic Mass**
   Mass increases with velocity:
   \[
   m = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]
   where m₀ is rest mass and v is velocity.
