# Inline Math Examples

Mathematical notation can be seamlessly integrated within text using the inline math syntax `\(formula\)`.

## Basic Arithmetic

Regular text with inline math: \(1 + 2 = 3\). More complex expressions like \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\) are also easy to include.

## Complex Formulas

Einstein's famous equation \(E = mc^2\) relates energy and mass.

The quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\) gives solutions to quadratic equations.

## Calculus

The derivative of a function is defined as \(\frac{df}{dx} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\).

For \(f(x) = x^2\), the derivative is \(f'(x) = 2x\).

## Greek Letters

Greek letters are commonly used in mathematics: \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), \(\gamma\), \(\Delta\), \(\pi\).

The famous formula for the area of a circle: \(A = \pi r^2\).

## Inline vs. Block Math

This document focuses on inline math \(f(x) = y\), which is written as `\(formula\)`.

For block math, use:
- `\[formula\]` - Block math with brackets
- `$$formula$$` - Block math with dollar signs

## Mixed Formatting

You can combine inline math with **bold**, *italic*, or `code` formatting.

**Important equation**: \(F = ma\) is Newton's second law.

*Euler's identity*: \(e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0\) combines five fundamental constants.
